This is 

# Problem 1

The purpose of this part is the solution for problem 1.

First we create  a data frame comprised of **a random sample of size 10 and a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 0** 
from a_standard Normal distribution_:

```{r problem_1}
library(tidyverse)

  la_df = tibble(
  norm_samp = rnorm(10, mean = 0), 
  norm_samp_pos = norm_samp > 0,
  )


  
  
  
  
```
